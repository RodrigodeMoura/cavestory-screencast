Episode 58 - Heart Drops
========================

Problem:
 - Enemies drop hearts for the player to recover
 - 2 levels of hearts:
  Single +2 HP
  Multi  +6 HP

Special Effect Flash:
 - Starts off flashing between Red and White hearts
 - Flash period steadily decreases
 - For the last second
   - rotates between
      - Red heart
      - White heart
      - Invisible
   - Flash period no longer changes
 - For the few milliseconds: shows a white flash (from the death cloud)

Solution:
 - Pretty sure missiles are going to work the (exact?) same
    - let's call our struct: FlashingPickup
    - named constructors: heartPickup
Line formula (for interpolating flash effect):
 - y is the current flash period,
 - x is the current life time
 y = mx + b
 current_flash_period = slope * current_life_time + start_flash_period
 slope=(y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
      =(end_flash_period - start_flash_period) / (flicker_time)

Times:
 - life time = 8 Seconds
 - start flash period = 400 ms // start off flashing at 400 ms
 - end flash period = 100 ms // but end up flashing at 100 ms
 - Dissipate Time = life time - 25 ms // Show a white flash for the last few ms
CollisionBox:
 Single: x=5G, y=8G
         w=21G,h=19G
 Multi:  x=6G, y=7G
         w=26G,h=25G
Sprite:
   RED: x=2T, y=5T
   WHITE: x=+1T
   FLASH: x=1T, y=0T
