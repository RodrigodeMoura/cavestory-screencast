Episode 6 - Player Movement
===========================

Problem:
 - Quotes needs to walk left/right.

Details:
 - Cave Story uses ←↑→↓ for movement

 - When ← is pushed,
     1 - Quote faces left
     2 - Quote accelerates left
 - When ← is held,
     1 - Quote accelerates left
     2 - Quote does not exceed a maximum (horizontal) speed
 - When ← is released
     1 - Quote decelerates left, until velocity is 0
 - Similarly for →
 - When ← and → are pushed at the same time, Quote does not move

Two Problems:
 - Which way is Quote facing?
    - Not solved in this video.
 - Where on screen is Quote being drawn?
    - Solving this one.

Solution:
 - Introduce a Player class
   - sprite
   - x, y, velocity_x (velocity_y will come later)
   - startMovingLeft, startMovingRight, stopMoving
   - no movements will take place in the input-handling methods
   - update, draw

 Equations for walking (from physics):
   - x = x + velocity_x * time + (1/2) * acceleration_x * time^2
      - acceleration is negligible, so we will ignore it in this equation.
   - velocity_x = velocity_x + acceleration_x * time
      - but remember that we also have a max horizontal speed

   - acceleration_x varies based on Quote's state.
      - Walking Left:  acceleration_x = -walking_acceleration
      - Walking Right: acceleration_x = walking_acceleration

   - velocity_x also varies based on Quote's State.
      - Walking (already given): vx += ax * time
      - Standing: velocity_x = velocity_x / slowdown_constant (around 1.2)
