Episode 17 - Multiple Resolutions
=================================

Thus far we have been working with 32x32 sprites and 640x480 screen.

Problem:
 - The original Cave Story uses 16x16 sprites and 320x240 screen size.
 - I can't legally provide you with all of the media content, so you need to get it from the game yourself.
 - NIKALIS' Cave Story+

Solution:
 - .pbm files are really .bmp files with a (C)Pixel appended.
 - Convert all pixel values to screen-size agnostic values.
	- motion constants
	- collision rectangles
	- backdrop tiles
