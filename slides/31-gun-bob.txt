Episode 31 - Gun Bob/Oscillating Walk
=====================================

Problem:
 1 - We want a gun bob, synced with our player walk animation.
 2 - Player animation is wrong!
  While we have been looping
    Mid Stride (standing)
    Left Stride
    Right Stride
    Mid/Left/Right/ Mid/Left/Right/ Mid/Left/Right ...
  It should oscillate between
    Left Stride
    Mid Stride (standing)
    Right Stride
    Left/Mid/Right/Mid Left/Mid/Right/Mid

Why does it matter?
 - Our gun bob is synced to our walk stride: gun bobs up for left/right, down for mid
 - it looks weird to have it up two frames down one (should be every other)

Solution:
 - NOT an animated sprite (which is still valid for our first_cave_bat)
 - Walking animation which animates a StrideType enum
   - private class to player
   - replacing current walk AnimatedSprite with three static sprites and a StrideType
   - this is so we can sync our gun bob (we need to know more info than a sprite can provide)
