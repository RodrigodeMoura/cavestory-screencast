Episode 16 - Background Tiles
=============================

Problem:
 - Certain tiles that Quote walks in front of:
	- buildings
	- doorways
	- beds
	- chains
	- ETC!

Solution:
 - Another double vector of Sprites (not tiles)
   - background sprite-tiles don't have an impact on Quote ever (I think), so they can just be sprites.
