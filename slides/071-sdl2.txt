Episode 71 - Upgrade to SDL2
============================

Benefits (for us):
 - Using new SDL2 library (vs. 1.2) gives us:
   - Scaling textures (for setting screen size)
   - OpenGL rendering (uses the graphics card for extra perf.)
   - Scancodes instead of keycodes (positional codes for the keyboard, keeps consistent for different layouts)

What changes?:
   - graphics:
      - Window is a layer of abstraction over the screen
         + replaces our SDL_Surface* screen
      - Renderer is a layer of abstraction over SDL's process of drawing
         + replaces our draw calls
      - Texture is a layer of abstraction over SDL's surfaces, used by the renderer
         + SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface
