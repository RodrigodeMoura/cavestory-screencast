Episode 35 - Fire a Projectile
==============================

Problem:
 - Polar Star should fire projectile when the player presses "x"

Solution:
 - Level1Projectile class
  - private to PolarStar, but we'll talk about this more soon.
  - update(elapsed_time) so that it can move
  - draw
  - start_x, start_y
  - HorizontalFacing, VerticalFacing, offset

 - fire button (implementation is identical to jump button)
