Episode 66 - General Slopes
===========================

Problem:
 - Implement General Formula for slopes

Solution:
 - General Formulas (from Episode 61)
   y = slope * (x - col) + offset + row
                |- perpendicular_position
   x = (y - row - offset) / slope + col
        |- perpendicular_position

   row,col,tile_type: stored in CollisionTile
   offset,slope: calculated from tile_type

 - one of two checks for collision
    calculated_position=calculated position (y or x)
    leading_position=position of the leading edge of the colliding entity
    side=the side of the TILE being collided with
    is_max_side?=side is BOTTOM or RIGHT (further along in the axis)

    if is_max_side? side
       leading_position <= calculated_position
    else
       leading_position >= calculated_position

    example:
      Projectile is going LEFT
         Projectile's leading position is its LEFT side
      side we are checking is RIGHT
         calculated position represents the right side
      since RIGHT is the max of (LEFT|RIGHT)
         collision occurs if leading position is <= calculated position

slope Tiles
+0.5  RIGHT-TOP, LEFT-BOTTOM
-0.5  LEFT-TOP , RIGHT-BOTTOM

offset Tiles
1T     LEFT-TOP-TALL   , RIGHT-BOTTOM-SHORT
0T     LEFT-BOTTOM-TALL, RIGHT-TOP-SHORT
0.5T   (Everything else)
