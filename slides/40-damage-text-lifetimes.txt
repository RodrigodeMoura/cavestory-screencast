Episode 40 - Damage Texts
=========================

Problem:
 - Damage Texts needs to outlive their owners
 - Damage Texts need to be drawn pretty close to last (but still before the HUD)

Solution:
 - DamageTexts class to own/update/draw all damage texts
 - Damageable: anything that can have a damage text (Player/enemy)
 
 Ideas?
 - map from shared_ptr<DamageText> -> Damageable*
	- every update, set DamageText's position to Damageable's position
	- Problem: how do we know that Damageable is exists?
 
 - Weak Ptr
   - works with shared_ptrs, but not scoped_ptrs
   - not even really a pointer. just lets you know how many shared_ptr owners there are for a given pointer
	  - vocab: reference count (or ref_count): the number of shared_ptr owners there are for a given pointer
   - need to be converted to a shared_ptr before use.

 - map from shared_ptr<DamageText> -> weak_ptr<Damageable>
