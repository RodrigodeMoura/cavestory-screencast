Episode 26 - Expanding Upon our Number Sprite
=============================================

Problem:
 - need to represent damage (red) text
 - need to prepend our number with +/-

Solution:
 - expand upon our number class with "named constructors"
   - really just static methods that return an object (a bit like our createTestMap)
   1 - HUDNumber
   2 - DamageNumber
   3 - ExperienceNumber  // But we'll deal with this later
