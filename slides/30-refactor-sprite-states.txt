Episode 30 - Refactor Sprite State
==================================

Problem:
 - Making sprite states is painful:
   1 - operator<
   2 - enum loops are painful

Solutions:
 1 - boost::tuple
   - syntax
   TYPE: boost::tuple<HorizontalFacing, VerticalFacing>
   CONSTRUCTION: boost::make_tuple(RIGHT, UP)
   ACCESSORS: Given tuple tup
     tup.get<0>() // returns the HorizontalFacing
     tup.get<1>() // returns the VerticalFacing

 2 - macros
  -general warning about macros. they are very powerful but can be very painful
  in macros, ## means "use the literal characters, and not the value"
  #define ENUM_FOREACH(enum_name) \
      FIRST_##enum_name
      // ex. calling MACRO(HORIZONTAL_FACING) is equivalent to FIRST_HORIZONTAL_FACING
