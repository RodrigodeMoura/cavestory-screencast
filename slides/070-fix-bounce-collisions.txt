Episode 70 - Fixing Bounce Collisions/Cleanup
=============================================

Problem:
 - Doritos fall through because of our collision check order

Solution:
 - Make sure to check the furthest collision out, rather than favoring
   the tiles we are centered over/beside.

Test:
 - Many doritos! for test.

Small Cleanup:
 - Remove (comment out) our debug code until we decide what to do with it.
