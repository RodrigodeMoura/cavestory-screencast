Episode 11 - Creating a Test Map
================================

A couple of cleanups in this episode:
 - Important:
   - SDL_Delay(ms_per_frame - elapsed_time_ms/*ms*/);
   - what if elapsed_time_ms is greater than 1000/kFps?
 - Trivial:
   - moving SDL_ShowCursor to the graphics class

Problem:
 - We want to have a map of walls to run into/jump on/jump off of.

Implementation:
 - Create the test map before the event loop

 - Map class to hold (for now):
   - Foreground Sprites - as a vector of vectors
   - CollisionMap - as a CollisionMap Object

 - CollisionMap to hold (for now):
   - CollisionRectangles - a list
