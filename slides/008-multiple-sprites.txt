Episode 8 - Multiple Sprites
============================

Problem:
 - Quote needs to be able to switch between sprites,
   based on his state.

Solution/Implementation:
 - Introduce a map from state -> sprites.
 - our 'SpriteState' will need to know:
     1) Are we walking?
     2) Are we facing left/right?
 - we will use a std::map, means we need an 'operator<' definition for our
   keys.
