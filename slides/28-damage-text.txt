Episode 28 - Damage Text (First Pass)
=====================================

From last episode:
 - radix/reversed_glyphs (credit goes to Sean Cline)

Problem:
 - We are looking at Quote, not at his health bar. How much damage did he just take?

Solution:
 - Damage text. appears where Quote is, and floats up.
    - floats one tile up in about half a second.
    - stays for about two seconds and then disappears.
