Episode 68 - 2D Data Structures
===============================

Problem:
 - Position, Velocity, Kinematics all come in x,y pairs.

Solution:
 - templatized Vector2D with +,-,*,/
   - also want to convert between different Vector2D types using our
     tileToGame et al
   - Will involve function pointers. Don't worry, it isn't too unfamiliar.
 - Kinematics2D
   - Not having +,- etc. but still has x,y
   - getters for position() and velocity()

What about Power Doritos?

yes. they are still buggy.
We are going to clean up our map collidable a lot before we fix that.
You'll all see.

It'll be ok.
