Episode 69 - Debugging Bounce Collisions
========================================

Problem:
 - Discover why Doritos bounce right through the floor.

Solution:
 - My debugging process:

 - Make the problem repeatable
   1. fix the timestep (make sure you do this first)
   2. remove randomness
      -provide srand with a seed, and you will get the same sequence of random values
      -e.g. srand(23)
            1st: rand() => 32
            2nd: rand() => 768
            3rd: rand() => 0

 - Make the problem easy to recognize
   - control time with a keypress
      - p => hold to play
      - n => play one frame
      - (right now we can only look forward in time, since we aren't recording game states)
   - make all collisions visual, by outlining which tile is being collided with
   - if necessary, remove clutter:
      - only need one dorito
      - don't need the bat or the player
