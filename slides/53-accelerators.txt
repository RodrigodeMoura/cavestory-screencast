Episode 53 - Accelerators
=========================

Problem:
 - Abstract out methods of acceleration:
   - Gravity
   - Friction
   - Constant Positive/Negative
   - Zero

Solution:
 - Accelerator struct
   - updateVelocity(Kinematics& kinematics, units::MS elapsed_time);
 - MapCollidable would then be able to update velocity as well
