Episode 15 - Introducing the Background
=======================================

Problem:
 - I'm tired of staring at a black background
 - Quote is actually drawing black pixels to the screen.

Solution:
 - Layers!
	- Foreground layer: wall tiles, water tiles
	- Entity layer(s): Quote, enemies, doors
	- Background layer: background tiles, chain tiles, 
	- Backdrop: stuff in the distant background. Sometimes solid color, sometimes cave texture
		- Fixed position
		- Parallax/other
 - Draw a backdrop
 - Draw background tiles
 - SDL_SetColorKey(SDL_Surface*, Uint32 flag, Uint32 color)
	- choose a color to make transparent
	- Pixel chose for us. It's black.
