Episode 27 - Timers
===================

Problem:
 - Have a couple of "time-keeping" variables, all updated identically (+= elapsed_time)
  - invincibility time
  - health text-change timer
  - ...and like a billion (hyperbole) more to come

Solution:
 - Organize logic into a Timer class
   - Given: expiration time

   At any point, we need to know:
   - expired?
   - active?
   - current time?

 - Bonus: timers are going to be self updating!
  - PROS: never have to worry about updating twice or not at all
          can call update once, and it will take care of things
  - CONS: Hides when the timers are updated from us!
            - "us" being the objects using timers
