Episode 59 - Collecting Health
==============================

Problem:
 - What happens when the player collects health?

Solution:
 - if there is more damage than health
       reduce damage
 - if there is more health than damage
       reduce damage to 0
       increase health by the amount leftover
 - if there is no damage
       increase health

 remember to update the fill sizes
