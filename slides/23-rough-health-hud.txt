Episode 23 - Roughing in the Health HUD
=======================================

Problem:
 - Need a visual indicator to keep track of player health.

Solution:
 1 - We are just going to do a roughing in. Placing sprites and such.
 2 - To make things easier, I'm introducing a half-tile constant of units::Game.
 3 - Bug fix: we aren't drawing pure black OR pure white. I made a bad assumption.
