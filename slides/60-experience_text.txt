Episode 60 - Experience Text
============================

Problem:
 - How much exp did I just collect?

Solution:
 - FloatingNumber ... just like DamageText
oh.
    - DamageText     ==> FloatingNumber(DAMAGE)
    - ExperienceText ==> FloatingNumber(EXPERIENCE)
but then so?
    - setDamage ==> addValue() (we are adding, not just setting)
ahh. that's not so bad

 - for experience, we'll need to update/setPosition!/draw ourselves
   - (no DamageTexts to do it for us)

1. rename files: damage_text.* ==> floating_number.*
2. DamageText ==> FloatingNumber
3. FloatingNumber(NumberType)
4. setDamage ==> addValue

and what about damage to our experience?
 - ok let's damage our experience, too (2 per health)
