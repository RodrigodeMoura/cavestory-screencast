Episode 25 - Player Health
==========================

Problem:
 - Keep track, visually and in-game, of player health.
 - BONUS: more visual indicators for damage

Solution:
 - struct Health
   - units::HP max_health
   - units::HP current_health
   - units::MS damage_time_    // Time to keep track of until damage change occurs
   - our HUD sprites
   - a new damage_fill sprite

 - VaryingWidthSprite
   - Our fill bars need to change width.

Sub-problem:
 - Need to calculate how wide to make health fill/damage.
      /-FillWidth?
 |---/----|
 |=========---------|
 |- Max_Fill_Width -|

 Max_Health =  6
 Current_Health =  3

 FillWidth = Max_Fill_Width * Current_Health / Max_Health
 - Pro-tip: We can (and will) think of this width as an offset from the left.
