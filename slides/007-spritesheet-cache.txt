Episode 7 - Spritesheet Cache
=============================

Problem:
 - Many sprites use one spritesheet (stand. walk left. walk right. etc.)
 - Loading the same spritesheet over and over again.

Solution:
 - Create a cache of the spritesheets (in CPU memory).
 - Sprites will no longer have 'control' of SDL_Surfaces,
    - Don't create, don't delete.
    - To show this, we will use:  typedef SDL_Surface* SurfaceID
 - We will store SDL_Surfaces in the Graphics class.
 - std::map<std::string, SDL_Surface*> sprite_sheets
