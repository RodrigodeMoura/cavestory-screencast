55 - Simple Collision Rectangle
===============================
   
Problem:
 - Create a CollisionRectangle from 1 rectangle instead of 4

Solution:
 - CollisionRectangle is interface, split into:
   - CompositeCollisionRectangle - made of 4 rectangles (top/left/bottom/right)
   - SimpleCollisionRectangle - made of 1 rectangle
 - Since SimpleCollisionRectangle is made of 1 rectangle...

 - we need to make sure to make Simple's bounding box a little bit bigger than
   its rectangle.
   - otherwise, when we updateX, we will still be colliding
