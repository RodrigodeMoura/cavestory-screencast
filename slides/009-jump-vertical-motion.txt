Episode 9 - Player Jump
=======================

Problem:
 - Quote should Jump when z is pressed.
    - Corollary. Quote should fall.
 - Quote should not fall through the 'floor'.

Details:
 1) Quick keypress == Short Jump (1.5 tiles, but we'll measure later)
 2) Long keypress  == High Jump (3 tiles. again. We'll measure later)

So:
 - When jump is pressed, initial velocity up
 - When jump is held, gravity has no effect.
    - Corollary: When jump expires, or button is released, gravity is in effect.
 - Once in free-fall, jump has no effect
    - Corollary: If jump is pressed/released/pressed before expiration
                 and before free-fall, gravity will not have effect.

Implementation:
 - Introduce nested class: Jump
   - hides jump details from player class.
   - keep track of
      1) active
      2) total amount of time remaining in jump.
 - What do we need to know?
   - +y is down, and -y is up (top-left corner is 0,0)
   - are we on the ground?
      - true when we collide with floor. false otherwise
   - has our jump expired?
      - velocity_y >= 0 or
      - time_remaining <= 0
