Episode 4 - Animated Sprites
============================

Problem:
 - We want to see Quote's walk animation!

Details:
 - each frame takes the same amount of time
 - animation keeps looping forever!

Solution:
 - Create an Animated Sprite class!
    - Needs to be updated before drawn.
    - needs all of the functionality of our Sprite class
    - In addtion, keeps track of:
         number of frames,
         current frame,
         time per frame,
         time since the last frame-change,
   - Our assumptions about the Bitmap:
         frames are laid out left to right
         frames are spaced at tile_size
