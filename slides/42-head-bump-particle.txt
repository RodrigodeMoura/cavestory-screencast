Episode 42 - Head Bump Particle
===============================

Problem:
 - Small particle effect when Quote bumps his head

Solution:
 - We have implemented a lot of this before:
  - 2 Sprites
  - "Caret.bmp"
    - x=116 GU
	- y=54 GU
	- w=h=6 GU
  - move outward from a central point (center_x(), top())
  - speed=0.12 GU/ms
  - random angles [0, 360) Degrees
  - random distances [4, 20] Game Units
  - Flash period=25 ms
  - particles expire after 600 ms
