Episode 67 - Sticky Collisions
==============================

Problem:
 - Quote needs to stick to slopes as he is going down
 - See Ep. 61

Solution:
 - When do we stick?
   (Algorithm from ep 61)
 - If grounded on a slope AND
      intersecting with a slope tile

 - If grounded on a wall AND
      intersecting with tall slope tile

 - If grounded on a short slope AND
      intersecting with an empty tile AND
      the tile below the empty tile is not empty
   - Just kidding about this one. Collision order takes care of it.

Sub-Problem 1:
 - what are we grounded on?

Solution:
 - Store in player class as boost::optional<TileType>

Sub-Problem 2:
 - When do we do our check?

Solution:
 - only if we are going down
 - immediately after we have checked for a "real" collision
