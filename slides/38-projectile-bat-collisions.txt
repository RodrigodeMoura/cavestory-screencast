Episode 38 - Projectile/Bat Collisions
======================================

Problem:
 - Our projectiles should collide with the bat.
  - Sub problem. where to do the collision check?

Solution:
 - Collision check in Game::update
Alternatives:
   - Could do it in the enemy class?
   - Could do it in the projectile class?
   - Could (and probably will) make a new class/namespace to handle collisions

 - Collision check in Game::update
   - need a Projectile interface
      - collisionRectangle()
      - contactDamage()
   - vector<Projectile> Player::getProjectiles()
