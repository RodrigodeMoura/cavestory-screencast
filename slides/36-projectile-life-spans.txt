Episode 36 - Projectiles Have a Life Span
=========================================

Problems:
 1 - Projectiles need to move in the direction they are fired.
 2 - Projectiles need to be removed when they reach the end of their lifespan
    - approx. 3.5 tiles
 3 - Polar Star limited 2 projectiles onscreen at any one time

Solution:
 1 - update(elapsed_time)
     - velocity approximately 0.6f G.U./ms
     - if offset > 3.5, delete

 2 - startFire()
     - 2 projectiles
     - if both projectile slots are taken, don't fire.
