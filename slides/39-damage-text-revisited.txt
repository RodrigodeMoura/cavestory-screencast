Episode 39 - Damage Text Revisited
==================================

Problem:
 - Damage Text needs to add damage.
 - also let's give damage text to our bat

Details:
 - first hit:
    - reads "-1"
    - starts floating upward
 - subsequent hits:
    - damage text decreases by -1
    - STOPS floating upward
 - disappears 2 seconds after last hit
