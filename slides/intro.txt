Welcome to Re-constructing Cave Story
=====================================

What is Cave Story?
 - an action-platformer in the vein of Megaman
 - game made by Pixel on his off-time in 5 years

What this isn't:
 - a deconstruction of Pixel's code
 - art/music/asset creation walkthrough
 - a tutorial on the C++ language, or C++ language constructs

What this is:
 - a journey to re-construct Cave Story
 - an intermediate level learning experience for C++
 - a look at building a detailed game engine

Why do this?
 - full-detail game engines are very complex
 - help people appreciate how awesome Cave Story is!



What we'll need:
================

This Episode:
SDL v1.2

Later Episodes:
boost v1.48
