Episode 65 - Collision Order
============================

Problem:
 - improve Collision Order

Solution:
 - Collision Order (from Episode 61)
   if horizontal(direction):
      - primary sort COLS in direction
      - secondary sort rows favoring center_x
   if vertical(side):
      - primary sort ROWS in direction
      - secondary sort cols favoring center_y

 - getCollidingTiles needs a direction, now, too

 - what do I mean by sort?
    - I mean insertion order
    - for first_primary : last_primary
       - for first_secondary : last_secondary

 - secondary sort:
    - how to favor center (x or y)?
     calculate min, mid, and max as tile units
     if distance between min&mid is greater than mid&max
        then
           mid is closer to max, so we start with max
        else
           start with min
