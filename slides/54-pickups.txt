54 - Pickups
============

Problem:
 - Need a system to keep track of pickups (hearts/missiles/doritos)
 - What describes a pickup?

Solution:
 - Pickup:
  - draw(graphics)
  - collisionRectangle() - determine if the player is colliding
  - bool update(elapsed_time, map) - update position/sprite. true=alive, false=dead
  - value() - how many missiles/HP/EXP is it worth?
  - type() - is it health? Missile? Experience?

 - Player:
  - collectPickup(Pickup& pickup)

 - Pickups:
  - set<shared_ptr<Pickup> >
  - draw(graphics) - drawn after enemies before player
  - update(elapsed_time, map) - removes dead pickups
  - handleCollisions(player) - checks collisions: calls player.collectPickup and kills pickup
  - add(shared_ptr<Pickup>)
