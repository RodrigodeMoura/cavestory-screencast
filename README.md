====================

The Official Repository to accompany the Reconstructing Cave Story video series. http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL006xsVEsbKjSKBmLu1clo85yLrwjY67X

IMPORTANT: As of Episode 17 of Reconstructing CaveStory we switch to using the media from the original freeware version. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqAPmJuSMgk&list=PL006xsVEsbKjSKBmLu1clo85yLrwjY67X&index=19
You can get the Sprites (.pbm files) from there.

ALSO IMPORTANT: Use the tags of the format "011" and not "Ep011". The Ep011 style tags are mesed up. My bad.
